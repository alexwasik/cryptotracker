# CryptoCurrency Tracker
## A VueJS Project

### Note: The API that powered this was shut down March 2020. Maybe in the future I will update this using the new API.

This CryptoCurrency Tracker was built with VueJS and Bootstrap and tracks
the Top 10 CryptoCurrencies, refreshing them in  every 5 minutes.

It utilizes the metadata from the cryptocompare API (https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/) and gets pricing from CoinMarketCap
(https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)
